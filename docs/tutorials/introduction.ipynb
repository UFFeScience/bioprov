    "## Introduction to BioProv\n",
    "\n",
    "BioProv is a library to record provenance information of bioinformatics workflows. If you work with genomics, you've probably encountered the situation where you have several different files for a number of biological samples, and each file concerns a certain aspect of your data. As you develop your analysis workflow, it is challenging to keep track of the **provenance** of your data: how, when and why each file was created and/or modified. There are many tools to aid in this task, such as [version control](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668), [scientific workflow management systems](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan_Mercier/publication/331422146_Evaluating_Workflow_Management_Systems_A_Bioinformatics_Use_Case/links/5d961df9299bf1c363f577b4/Evaluating-Workflow-Management-Systems-A-Bioinformatics-Use-Case.pdf), or even simply keeping a [tidy computational notebook](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004385).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these practices are certainly helpful and [we recommend that you employ them](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510), it is not trivial to integrate and share provenance information across different people, research groups and even computing environments. A solution to this has been the development of [W3C-PROV](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/), a standard created by the W3C organization to facilitate the exchange of provenance data in the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "The W3C-PROV is composed of a set of [13 documents](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/), of which maybe the most pertinent to us is the [W3C-PROV-DM](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-prov-dm-20130430/), which describes a data model to represent provenance information. Although this model is widely implemented in a range of domain applications, including to [scientific workflows](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p2082-sousa.pdf), to the best of our knowledge, there is not yet a software tool specialized in the provenance of biological data structures and bioinformatics workflows. To extract provenance attributes of common file formats and common project organization patterns in bioinformatics, generic provenance extraction systems must be extended or customized, which can be a costly task for both the domain specialist and the developers of said systems. In order to fulfill this gap, we present BioProv, which aims to facilitate the provenance extraction in bioinformatics workflows by providing a Python library which integrates two open source libraries: [BioPython](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/25/11/1422/330687) and [Prov](https://prov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "BioProv is **project-based**, where each **Project** contains a number of **Samples** which have associated **Files**. **Files** may also be associated directly with the **Project**, if they contain information about zero or multiple samples. BioProv also stores information about **Programs** used create new and modify existing **Files**. **Programs** may contain **Parameters** which will determine how they will be run. Once a **Program** has been run, information about the process will be stored as a **Run**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, these are the main classes of the BioProv library:\n",
    "* **Project**\n",
    "* **Sample**\n",
    "* **Files**\n",
    "* **Programs**\n",
    "* **Parameters**\n",
    "* **Runs**\n",
    "\n",
    "See an example on how to run a program with BioProv."

    "Okay, there's a lot going on in this last code block. The first thing is creating the program we are going to run. We then create two variables: the kmer we wish to count and an item in the `sample.files` dictionary with a `bioprov.File` with the path we want. To build this file path, we use the `directory` attribute of the `'assembly'` file. This is a PosixPath object from the `pathlib` module, so it can be used for severeal operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we create parameters to be added to the `grep` program. Parameters are strings which are added to the program's command-line. We can just put a string with all of our parameters, but creating them one by one and enclosing them with the `bp.Parameter` class will allow for querying later. Parameters are then added with the `Program.add_parameter()` method. We then bind the **Program** to the **Sample** using the `Sample.add_programs()` method. It's important to remember these two methods: `Program.add_parameter()` and `Sample.add_programs()`. They allow BioProv to resolve internal relationships between each class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we check our command is correct: each `bioprov.Program` instance has a `Program.cmd` attribute which shows the exact command-line which will be run on the UNIX shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we want to run our program. We use the `Program.run()` method. "

    "We've learned the basics of BioProv, like the main classes, how to create **Projects**, **Samples**, and **Programs.** However, the point of BioProv is to be able to convert these elements to the W3C-PROV format. You can couple BioProv Projects (or any other BioProv object, for that matter) to W3C-PROV elements, allowing them to be exported as W3C-PROV documents, implemented with the [Prov](https://github.com/trungdong/prov) library.
