# Summary

The development and implementation of bioinformatics workflows (BWFs) is a common activity in life science research.
Despite the wide availability of tools to manage scientific workflows [@cite], the formal representation of
 BWFs remains a challenge. A particurlarly important aspect of any scientific workflow representation
 is the description of an object's *provenance* [@cite], which documents its computational origins, and promotes
 the reproducibility of the workflow which processes or generates said object.
 
 Although there are examples of the formal representation of provenance in BWFs, the provenance extraction of domain 
 specific (biological) data needs to either be implemented by hand, or by using a generic provenance extraction tool (e.g. [@cite]),
 or is already integrated in the tool (e.g. [@cite qiime2]). In order to improve this, we present BioProv, a Python
 software library for the provenance representation of biological data structures and workflows.
